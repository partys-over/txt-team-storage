# Pokemon Showdown Team Storage
##### Created by dom/partys over
This resource is to store Pokemon Showdown teams in a real time updating system, on github or another alternative.
## How to use

- Make folders for each format. OU Teams would be in a gen7ou folder, BW Ubers teams would be in a gen5ubers folder, etc.
- Get your importable from PS
- Make a new .txt file with the importable. Save this file as whatever you want but #1, in the correct folder and #2 use dashes instead of spaces in the filename. I think. Maybe spaces work? Dashes are just easier though, as it saves you a bit of "s in the terminal.
- You can add a description by adding "Description: (text)" Make sure it is on the same line. This won't be added to allteams.
- Do ``python add.py folder/[team-file-name].txt`` in your terminal, once you've ``cd``'d to the directory you're in. For the sample team I provided I did ``python add.py gen71v1/dom-double-bird.txt``
- If you have no clue what the hell I'm talking about with the code-y stuff then maybe [go here](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) or [probably here](https://computers.tutsplus.com/tutorials/navigating-the-terminal-a-gentle-introduction--mac-3855).
